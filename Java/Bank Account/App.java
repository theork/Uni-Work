 * rt.jar in project1/JRE System Library/rt,jar
 * pom.xml contains all the data needed to build the project
 * libraries in project1/Maven Dependencies
 * assertEquals has methods for most data types. assertArrayEquals is for arrays of different types. assertTrue/assertFalse used for booleans
 * trim is needed because println includes a new line character at the end. Trim gets rid of this so the assert matches
 * system.out needs to be put back because otherwise any calls to print on the console will not show.
